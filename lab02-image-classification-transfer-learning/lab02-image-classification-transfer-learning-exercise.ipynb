    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select another pretrained model (e.g., VGG16, MobileNetV2, or EfficientNet) and fine-tune it for CIFAR-10 classification.  \n",
    "You'll find the pretrained models in [Tensorflow Keras Applications Module](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Before training, inspect the architecture using model.summary() and observe:\n",
    "- Network depth\n",
    "- Number of parameters\n",
    "- Trainable vs Frozen layers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then compare its performance with ResNet and the custom CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which model achieved the highest accuracy?\n",
    "- Which model trained faster?\n",
    "- How might the architecture explain the differences?"
